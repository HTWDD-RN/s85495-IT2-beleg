  allow resynchronization after an error. Since most JPEG images are transmitted over error-free channels,
  they're rarely needed. A restart interval is defined with the FFDD marker as a 2-byte number. This tells how
  many MCUs between restart markers. When you encounter a restart marker (FFD0-FFD7), reset the DC values
  (Y,Cr,Cb) to 0 and the bitstream is started on a byte boundary (after the FFDx). It's simply a matter of
   counting through the restart interval over and over as you decode the image.
  The restart marker values will increment from FFD0 to FFD7 and then start again at FFD0
